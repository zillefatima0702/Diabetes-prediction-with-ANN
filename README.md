# Diabetes-prediction-with-ANN
Diabetes Prediction Through ANN is a simple deep learning project that uses an Artificial Neural Network to predict diabetes from the Pima Indians Dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras to perform accurate binary classification for early diabetes detection.
